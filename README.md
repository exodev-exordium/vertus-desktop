# Vertus (Desktop)

An open source terminal, ssh, and sftp-client for desktop platforms, made with `electronjs`, `ionic`, and `capacitor`.

## Features

- [ ] `electron-updater`, for automatic detecting, downloading and installing of new updates released on our [public GitHub](https://github.com/exordium-dev/vertus-desktop/releases) repo.

## Documentation

Due to the fact we are using so many different resources and frameworks for this project, the documentation can get extensive. Just after one day working on this project I noticed there were going to be a ton of little things I would forget. So, for my knowledge, here are some documentation regarding different features of this application. If more documentation is needed for those trying out this program, feel free to create an issue and recommend some changes.

#### Electron

More information regarding any specific `electron` code can be found within our [/docs](docs/ELECTRON.md) folder.

#### Building

More information regarding building `Ionic 5`, and `Capacitor` for `Electron` can be found under our [/docs](docs/BUILDING.md) folder.

#### Testing

When it comes to testing this is quite simple, we just run a basic capacitor command `npx cap open electron` after [building](#building) for ionic.
